# Sky Javascript technical test

The work i have committed took approx 90 minutes to complete.

## Tech choices

I have used Jest as my choice of javascript testing framework to write my assertions.

I have chosen to utilise ES6 features.

As instructed, I have not installed Babel as a dependency.

## Presumptions

If running the redeem service scripts in the browser, Im presuming the end user is using the latest version of Chrome (v51+).
I have not tested Javascript support against legacy versions or any other browser.

Test against node version 5.6.0

## Running tests

To run tests, `cd` to the root of the project, and run `npm run test`.

## To do
